# Agile Scrum Plan for Godot Game Development

## Project Overview
Develop a simple 2D game using the Godot engine in style of space shooter.
The game must have good playability and time needed to finish has to be in minutes. 

## Team Members
- Product Owner: AT
- Scrum Master: AT
- Development Team: AT

## Sprint Overview
We will conduct two sprints, each lasting one day. The goal is to develop a playable version of the game by the end of Sprint 2.

## Sprint 1: Game Prototype and Basic Mechanics 

### Goals
- Set up the project in Godot.
- Implement basic game mechanics.
- Create placeholder graphics and sound effects.

### Sprint Backlog
1. **Set Up Project**
   - Initialize Godot project repository.
   - Set up version control (Git).
   - Configure project settings in Godot.
   
2. **Player Character**
   - Design player character sprite (placeholder).
   - Implement player movement (left, right, jump).
   - Add player animations (idle, walk, jump).

3. **Main scene**
   - Design basic level layout (placeholder tiles).
   - Implement collision detection.
   - Add camera to follow player.

4. **Basic Mechanics**
   - Implement main controls.

5. **User Interface**
   - Create main menu screen (placeholder).
   - Implement basic UI elements (score display, health bar).

6. **Sound Effects**
   - Add placeholder sound effects for player actions (jump, collect item).

### Tasks
- Create Git repository and push initial project setup.
- Code player movement script in GDScript.
- Design and implement basic level using Godot's tilemap editor.
- Implement basic enemy AI with GDScript.
- Design main menu layout and UI elements.
- Integrate sound effects and background music into the project.

### Daily Standups
- Discuss progress on tasks.
- Identify any blockers.
- Plan work for the day.

### Sprint Review
- Demonstrate game prototype with basic mechanics.
- Gather feedback from the product owner and stakeholders.

### Sprint Retrospective
- Discuss what went well and what could be improved.
- Plan any adjustments for the next sprint.

## Sprint 2: Game Polishing and Additional Features

### Goals
- Polish existing game mechanics and graphics.
- Implement additional features.
- Prepare the game for release.

### Sprint Backlog
1. **Graphics and Animation**
   - Create final versions of player and enemy sprites.
   - Implement additional animations (attack, death).
   - Design and add background and foreground elements.

2. **Game World Enhancements**
   - Design additional levels.
   - Add environmental hazards (spikes, pits).
   - Add scoring system.

3. **Advanced Mechanics**
   - Implement respawn system.

4. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Implement end screen with score summary.

5. **Sound and Music**
   - Add final sound effects and background music.
   - Implement sound settings in the options menu.

6. **Testing and Bug Fixing**
   - Conduct playtesting sessions.
   - Fix identified bugs.
   - Optimize game performance.

### Tasks
- Design and animate final player and enemy sprites.
- Code advanced enemy behaviors and power-up effects.
- Design improved UI elements and menus.
- Integrate final sound effects and music tracks.
- Conduct testing and fix any bugs found.

### Daily Standups
- Review progress on tasks.
- Address any blockers.
- Plan work for the day.

### Sprint Review
- Demonstrate game with additional features.
- Gather feedback from the product owner and stakeholders.

### Sprint Retrospective
- Discuss successes and areas for improvement.
- Plan for future updates or releases.

## Definition of Done
- The game is playable and free of major bugs.
- All planned features are implemented.
- The game has final graphics and sound.
- The game is ready for release or further development.

## Conclusion
By following this Agile Scrum plan, we aim to develop a simple Godot game within two sprints. Regular reviews and retrospectives will ensure continuous improvement and adaptation to any changes or feedback.
